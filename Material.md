## AD603 AGC

The AD603 is a low noise, voltage controlled amplifier for radio frequency (RF) and intermediate frequency (IF) automatic gain control (AGC) systems. It provides accurate pin-selectable gain ranging from −11 dB to +31 dB at 90 MHz and +9 dB to +51 dB at 9 MHz. Any intermediate gain range can be obtained with an external resistor. The input referred noise spectral density is only 1.3 nV/√Hz and consumes 125 mW with the recommended ±5 V supply.
